## Why you asking a new feature ?
---
What are you trying to do and how would you want to do it differently? Is it something you currently you cannot do? Is this related to an issue/problem?

## Alternatives is it possible ?
---
Can you achieve the same result doing it in an alternative way? Is the alternative considerable?

## If the feature request is approved, would you be willing to submit a PR ?
---

- [ ] Yes ((Help can be provided if you need assistance submitting a PR))
- [ ] No

## Before create issue I check if :
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better
- [Â ] The feature hasn't already asked
